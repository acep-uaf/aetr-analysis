# Data Visualization and Analysis

This branch includes Jupyter notebooks, data, appendix tables, and figures used in the following sections of the 2024 Alaska Electricity Trends Report:
- Capacity, `capacity.ipynb`
- Generation, `net-generation.ipynb`
- Consumption, `consumption.ipynb`

A virtual environment for this repository requires installs of `pandas`, `matplotlib`, their dependencies, and anything specific to running Jupyter notebooks. I have included a list of packages I used in my virtual environment in `requirements.txt`. This can be installed *inside* your virtual envrionment with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
